Recently, we conducted our second monthly tech meetup on __10th July 2021, Saturday__. Preparing for the second meet up was quite challenging, because we had already set a goal by the first meetup.

About TECH Setu, it is a student-led non-profit initiative with a mission to bridge the gap between IT Industry and Students. And, monthly meetup is one of our initiatives where students share their learnings and engineers share their experiences.

## Pre-event Proceedings

For this event, we decided to have something different and exciting. Hence, from this meetup onwards we introduced the Lightning Talk concept.

_“A lightning talk is a very short presentation lasting only a few minutes, given at a conference or similar forum.”_ - Wikipedia

This way our talk lineup was one student speaker, one industry speaker, three lightning speakers and one keynote speaker. The theme of the event was “Make a bridge between IT Industry and Students”. The event was targeted for the students to secure a future in the IT industry.

All the speakers were selected by the advice of our mentors and through a call to talk proposal.

The promotion of the event started on 27th June with the announcement of the Lightning Speaker, Mr. Nikhil Aryal on the TECH Setu’s official Facebook page. The registration form was opened from the very first day. We used social platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn as our outreach and promotion platforms. Similarly, with a time gap of a day, we kept on posting about our event to grab the necessary attention of the potential audience.

The announcement of second Industry Speaker Miss Sima Thapa and then as Lightning Speakers was Mr. Budh Ram Gurung and Ebraj Gurung was announced by a couple of days after the previous speaker’s announcement.

Gradually, on 6th July we announced our Keynote Speaker Mr. Bishworaj Poudel who was sharing his invaluable insights on the topic “5 Lessons to build your successful Path” Finally, three days before the event, we announced our Student Speaker Miss. Sadhana Sapkota.
