Have you ever used some software like a web browser or some Operating system and wished that if you were able to customize it completely as you like? Or have you ever felt that you need some extra hands for the personal project you are working on? Or have you ever felt like using apps that you can completely trust on or completely dissect to look at what is happening behind the scenes?

If yes, then the ultimate solution for your all problems can be Open Source.

The word open source is being popular day by day in the IT field recently. But what is open source?

{% include image.html path="blogs/sfd/sfd.jpg" %}

Open source is a type of licensing agreement that allows users to freely modify a work, use that work in new ways, integrate the work into a larger project, or derive a new work based on the original. By removing barriers between innovators, open-source promotes a free exchange of ideas within a community to drive creative, scientific, and technological advancement.

Although it is most commonly used in the software industry, professionals utilize open-source licenses in many industries: biotech, electronics, fashion, robotics, teaching, and photography to name a few. But this article will focus exclusively on software applications.

## Why open-source?

Open source promotes the sharing of programs and ideas among members of user communities who have similar needs, but who also may have diverse technology acquisition and funding strategies. Open source reduces development cycle time and decreases design, implementation, and quality assurance costs for certain types of software, particularly systems infrastructure software such as operating systems, compilers and language-processing tools, editors, and middleware.

In short, with open source you can have the following advantages;

1. Open source is not dependent on the company or author that created it.

2. It does not have the problem of incompatible formats that exist in proprietary software.

3. Open source is free to use, distribute and modify.

4. It has lower costs, and in most cases, this is only a fraction of the cost of their proprietary counterparts.

5. Open source software is more secured as the code is accessible to everyone. Anyone can fix the bugs as they are found and users do not have to wait for the next release.

6. High-quality programs can be accessed easily.

7. Open-source software provides the platform to make add-ons or contribute to the project publicly, thus directly or indirectly promoting your software.

Now, letâ€™s talk about how you can be involved in the open-source community. The open-source community is made up of diverse open-minded people constantly giving their best efforts to promote the use of the open-source. These continuous involvements and improvements have caused the creation of several programs, workshops, and events being organized periodically and one of them is software freedom day.

## Software Freedom Day

Software Freedom Day (SFD) is an annual worldwide celebration of Free Software organized by the Digital Freedom Foundation (DFF). SFD is a public education effort to increase awareness of Free Software and its virtues and encourage its use.

SFD was established in 2004 and was first observed on 28th August of that year. About 12 teams participated in the first Software Freedom Day. Since that time it has grown in popularity and while organizers anticipated more than 1,000 teams in 2010 the event has stalled around 400+ locations over the past two years, representing a 30% decrease over 2009. Since 2006 Software Freedom Day has been held on the third Saturday of September. In 2021, this event will be held on 18th September.

## Objectives of Software Freedom Day

1. Encourage, foster, and celebrate the adoption of free software, standards, software freedom, and the people behind it.

2. Promote the local IT ecosystem including IT companies, IT users, and policymakers about the importance and benefit for users, open-source software, and software freedom.

3. Demonstration, distribution, troubleshooting, and expert advice on various Linux distribution and enterprise applications.

So, this worldwide event can be a very good opportunity for beginners to start their open source journey and take a look at what other open-source enthusiasts are focusing on plus, it can be a very good opportunity for professional developers and open-source enthusiasts to promote awareness about open sourcing and being a part of the open-source community.

To take part in this event, you can visit this [Link](https://www.softwarefreedomday.org/map/index.php?year=2021) and find the nearest place where the event is happening and follow the instructions for registration which depends from program organizers to organizers.
